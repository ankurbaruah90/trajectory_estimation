A ROS based monocular visual odometry package. 
Development base was inspired from an article and a subsequent 
code on monocular visual odometry found in https://avisingh599.github.io/vision/monocular-vo.


1. The node subscribes to camera images.
2. Extracts FAST/ORB/OPENSURF features from each frame.
3. Tracks the features in subsequent frames. Re-extracts features if the number of features drops below a certain threshold.
4. Estimates the essential matrix once matching pair of features are found.
5. Recovers the rotation and translation matrix from the essential matrix.
6. Computes the overall transformation by concatenating the rotation and translation matrices.


TODO:
1. Solve the scale ambiguity.
2. Validate the estimated trajectory.
